Waltz acquires, aggregates \nand presents data from a set of distinct authoritative/golden \nsources to provide insights into the state of DB's data, \napplication and technology assets. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo measure the progress towards DB's strategic goals, Waltz provides \na set of indicators that include KPI's and KRI's (Key Performance / Risk Indicators)\nwhich can be accessed from any of the tabs at the top of the screen.\n</p>\n<p>\nWaltz is not an alternative to existing architecture-related solutions in \nDB (such as PowerDesigner, Sparx or other Enterprise Architecture tool); \nit complements these solutions and enables integration with them as \nthe need arises.\n</p>\n<p>\nMore information about Waltz is available on the\n<a href='https://confluence.gslb.db.com/display/CTCTOWALTZ/Group+Architecture+Waltz+Home' target='_new'>Waltz Confluence Site</a>.\nIf you have any questions, observations or suggestions please direct them to the  \n<a href='mailto:waltz.support@db.com;?Subject=Waltz%20Feedback' target='_top'>\n    Waltz team\n    <i class='fa fa-envelope-o'></i>\n</a>\n</p>\n</div>",
