# 1.35
Waltz version 1.35 has been [released](https://github.com/finos/waltz/releases/tag/1.35).

This release gives many enhancements to Flow Diagrams and Authority statements, see the above release notes for more information

## Trial Docker Image

Two docker images have been posted up to DockerHub.  They are:

- [waltz-web](https://hub.docker.com/layers/davidwatkins73/waltz-web/1.35/images/sha256-1c99cd9df1aa98457677129eae9581c8f12477faa4866d689c1757c0cca05ca0?context=repo)  - the core Waltz runtime 
- [waltz-sample-db](https://hub.docker.com/layers/davidwatkins73/waltz-sample-db/1.35/images/sha256-214b9e6b409c828b8ffa40f215b8880f638fd7c2b9e02a9b9f0571f5001125ca?context=repo) - a postgres database image with sample data  

There is a sample `docker-compose` file and instructions for usage hosted in the [waltz-demo-docker](https://github.com/davidwatkins73/waltz-demo-docker) repo.


# 1.36
The main focus of 1.36 will be around Authority statements. 
In 1.35 we added the ability to add different rating outcomes (_Authorised Distributor_, _Heritage Source_, _Wrong Sourced_ etc).
In 1.36 we will be renaming Authority statements to be _Flow Classification Rules_ and providing users with more views and tools to help understand their data landscapes.

As usual, all tasks are being tracked via [Github issues](https://github.com/finos/waltz/issues) and feel free to contact us if you'd like more information.
