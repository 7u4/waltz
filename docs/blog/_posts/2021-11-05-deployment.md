# Overview

In October 2021 we gave a short talk at the FINOS members-only meetup in London which detailed how to get Waltz up and running quickly.

We have re-recorded the session and have posted it up onto YouTube. 

Topics covered:

- Overview of Waltz
- Deployment options
- Setting up a database
- Populating with sample data
- Deploying the application to a web container
- Anatomy of a data loader
- Waltz: Use Case Explorer)
