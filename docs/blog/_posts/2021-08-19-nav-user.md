# Overview

Waltz 1.36 (late August 2021) introduces a new way to navigate between sections on a page.  We have removed the horizontal section menu and replaced it with a new sidebar.  The sidebar makes it easier to see what sections are available and can be collapsed to save space.  

Give it a try and let us know what you think.
