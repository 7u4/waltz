# Overview

Waltz 1.36 (late August 2021) introduces several new features and some important fixes.

## Navigation

The most noticeable change is around the section navigation which is shown in the video below and is also explored in more detail in this dedicated [blog post](https://waltz.finos.org/blog/waltz/navigation/screencast/2021/08/19/nav-user.html).

## Flow Classification Rules
* Auth Sources have become _Flow Classification Rules_, this reflects how this feature has been evolving.
* Each flow classification rule has a dedicated view page which shows companion data.  _Companion Application Rules_ show where the source application is also mentioned in other rules, and _Companion Data Rules_ show any other rules which cover the data type.

## Attestations

* Attestation optimizations, giving users a more streamlined approach to attesting large numbers of applications.  
* Application viewpoint attestations were only viewable in the history tab.  We have now included a dedicated tab which shows the current state of the application viewpoint attestations for each category.
