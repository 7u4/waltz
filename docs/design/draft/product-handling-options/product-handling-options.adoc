== Overview

=== Approaches

This document discusses three approaches to modelling product options within Waltz.
They are:

* Use **measurables**, this approach has already been used with some success.
However, numerous deficiencies would need to be addressed to fully support the requirements.
* Use **applications**, enrich the application entity,  adding features needed to support product option requirements.
* Add a **new core entity** to Waltz which directly represents product options.

=== Requirements


=== Comparison of approaches

.Approaches to requirements
|===
| Requirement/Issue | Measurable Approach | Application Approach | New Entity Approach

| **Product identification**
| Simple, has it's own measurable category
| Complex, blurred boundaries between apps and products
| Simple, segregated by entity type

| **Hierarchies** (family, product, option)
| Already supports
| Difficult to retrofit to existing application model.
  Limited applicability outside this particular domain (e.g. non-product apps have no hierarchy)
| -

| **Lifecycle statuses** (e.g. buy, sell, hold)
| Add assessment rating
| Add assessment rating
| Add assessment rating

| **Overall Commission / Decommission dates**
| No support, outside of simple deprecation status
| -
| -

| **Alignment to Change Initiatives**
| Supported (via spindle)
| Already supports
| Need adding (low complexity)

| **IT Asset alignment**
| Alignment via 'implements' relationships between products and applications (assets)
| -
| -

| **Intra Product dependencies**
| Already supported via 'the spindle'
| New concept - currently only flows are intra-app (medium complexity)
| New concept (medium complexity)

| **Alignment to taxonomies** (Tech Function Taxonomy)
| Could be done via spindle.
  Alternatively, look to allow taxonomy items to have ratings on other taxonomy items (medium complexity).
| Already supports via ratings

| **Major Tech Version and Product alignment** (don't understand this requirement - what is a major tech version)
